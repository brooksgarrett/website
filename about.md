# I'm Brooks
I'm currently based out of sunny Jacksonville, FL and have a wonderful family. I'm infatuated with technology and can't wait to get my hands on the newest tools, techniques, and shiny objects so I can tear them apart and make cool things. That sounds really awesome but speaking thruthfully it really means I stare at a linux console. A LOT.

# I Went to College
Back around the turn of the century I found myself a bit aimless. Graduating from high school I knew I wanted to do something with computers. I thought about Georgia Tech but decided it wasn't really a fit for me (nor I for it.) Then I discovered Georgia Southern University in *BEAUTIFUL* Statesboro, GA beside the magic Eagle Creek. Southern gave me a chance to explore a tremendous breadth of computer science from programming, to IT management, to my eventual career in Information Security.

I'm proud to be a Southern Eagle Alumnus with a B.B.A. in Information Systems, Information Security Emphasis.

I spent a couple of years with this guy at my first real job out of college. Working at the Duck taught me the importance of teamwork, the value of work ethic, and a healthy respect for my peers. I worked closely with some incredibly talented people. Some pushed the envelope of IT with things like java web services running on top of old 60's mainframe code. Others demonstrated the value of persistence. Specifically the Security team I was on was second to none in every respect. In a team of just 5 (or 6) we had experts from every domain of IT knowledge. It was humbling.

Currently I work for these guys and more specifically Fortify on Demand. This has been an awesome experience thus far providing me the opportunity to grow, mature, and learn in a rapidly changing industry. If Application Security interests you then we should chat.

# I Play Some Awesome Sports
Rugby is by far the greatest sport on the planet *(citation needed...)* I started in college by playing with the [Columbus-Ft. Benning Cruisers](http://columbus-benningrugby.com) and spent an awesome season at Flank. Moving on I spent a year at wing with [Southern Rugby](http://southernrugby.webs.com/) before graduating and moving back to the Cruisers. Back with the Cruisers I spent 2 years at Hook and eventually served as the Match Sec. Now you can find me Tuesday and Thursday at practice working with the [Jax Rugby](http://jaxrugby.org/) club.
