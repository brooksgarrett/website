When mounting an image of a journaled filesystem, a couple of shortcuts repeatedly save me time and energy. First, VFAT and NTFS disks reserve (generally) the first 63 sectors for the partition table and meta info. Considering 512 is a very common size for sectors, 32256 becomes a very good number to remember.
<blockquote>32256 is the number of bytes you generally need to offset when mounting a volume.</blockquote>
This offset is done in mount as follows:
<blockquote>sudo mount -t [vfat, ntfs-3g, etc] -o ro,loop,offset=32256 /path/to/image /path/to/mountpoint</blockquote>
Excellent, so now we have our drive image (loop) mounted as a read-only (ro) volume and we told the mount command that the partition we are interested in begins 32,256 bytes into the image (63 sectors * 512 bytes per sector = 32,256 bytes; Thus offset=32256). A big problem with mounting journaled filesystems is their meta data. As a forensic investigator, you can not change the evidence volume. However, even when mounting a volume ro, the metadata still changes by incrementing the "times mounted" count. Â To avoid this, set the permissions on the image file itself to 444 or less (I prefer 440). This will prevent the counter increase and preserve your sound image.
