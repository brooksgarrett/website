I will not be a drone.

I will not live my life in 8 hour increments. I will not sacrifice myself nor my family for my career. My family gives me the strength and talent to make my career.

I will not be a drone.

I will not keep my head down and hope for survival by mediocrity, but will instead thrust forward and push the limits to guarantee my survival.

I wil not be a drone.

I am unique. I am not one of millions but one in a million. When told to conform I reform others. I will not be a voice in the croud but will create a voice for the crowd.

I will not be a drone.

I am a young professional. Empowered, strong willed, and armed with the knowledge I need to solve the challenges of my generation.

I will not be a drone.
