I came about in the InfoSec profession with the likes of [@SpaceRogue](http://twitter.com/spacerog) and [@ThisIsHNN](http://twitter.com/thisishnn) bringing me weekly digestibles of all the things happening in the world of InfoSec. My team would huddle in the forensics lab each Friday and bear witness to a painful ridicule or Adobe each and every week as we heard all about the latest vulns and exploits. Oh, and who would ever forget the running commentary that was the [Summer of Lulz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LulzSec). 

I miss that. I don't think anyone really has a solid rundown on the weekly events in InfoSec and thus I want to start one. This page will document my evolving attempt to launch a podcast. Caveat emptor, it's likely to fail but will be a solid journey.
