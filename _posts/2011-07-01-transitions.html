Today being the last day of my employment with Aflac IT, I'm looking forward to having the next 2 weeks off for myself.

My goals in the next 14 days:
<ol>
	<li>Two a day workouts - Cardio in the AM, weights in the PM</li>
	<li>Read, learn, experiment with WebAppSec</li>
	<li>Enjoy my new baby and wife</li>
</ol>
