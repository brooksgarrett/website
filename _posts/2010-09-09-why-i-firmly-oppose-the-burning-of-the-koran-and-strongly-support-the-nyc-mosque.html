My thoughts on why burning the Koran is bad, and allowing the Muslim community in NYC to build their Community Center/Mosque/Whatever. These are my thoughts, please feel free to form your own and argue with me. If, however, you begin quoting a major news outlet without your own critical analysis, I will most likely unfriend you instantly.

One is opening a community center. The group opening a center was not affiliated with the people who attacked our nation 9 years ago. The children who will utilize this building most likely weren't even alive during the attacks. We also do not currently persecute Christians because of the actions of a few radical Christian bombers in American history (You agree to remove Christian churches near the Atlanta Olympic Stadium, I'll agree to not like the mosque.)

The other is a group of people who are decrying a religious group as a whole because of one radical sects actions. American Muslims are American. They should not be faced with someone burning their religious text, though they must deal with it as it is certainly the right of the floridiots to burn the Koran.

Would you equate burning a cross in a black mans yard with building a community center, or burning the Koran? Burning the Koran is clearly an act of intimidation, building a community center is not. Establishing that connection makes apparent why one is appalling and the other is not.

Regarding separation of church and state, I defer to Thomas Jefferson (1802)Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should "make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," thus building a wall of separation between Church & State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.

With all that said, our poor pathetic excuse for a news media is hardly worth defending or debating. However, I will defend that to me one of these issues is logical is not malicious, and the other is malicious and sad, yet both are equally protected. I personally would love to see a large contingent of Muslims burn the Bible in retaliation (yet for such a fanatical religion, it would greatly surprise me to see this actually occur).

The most important thing to remember beyond all the politics is that on 9-11-2001, 343 FDNY personnel responded to their final tone and countless others will suffer permanent disability as a result of their heroic actions when their community called upon them. 9 years later, our Congress still can not agree on whether we as a nation should assist these souls in gaining financial support to treat their disabilities. Yet that same Congress is willing to consider violating the Constitution in order to stop a community building from being erected in the same area as a Sex shop, strip club, and 3 different bars. That to me is the ultimate outrage. </soapbox>
