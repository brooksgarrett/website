If you are receiving a 404 in WordPress, there are 2 possible causes:
<ul>
	<li>.htaccess</li>
</ul>
This file is located in your web root directory. Change the permissions to 666 then modify your PermaLink settings and save them. This will rewrite your .htaccess for you. Be sure to change it back to 440 when done.
<ul>
	<li>apached.conf</li>
</ul>
In the apache config for your web site, make sure AllowOverides is set to All.
