Something screwy is going on with Graphite and Django 1.5 (and it isn't documented ANYWHERE!)
When you attempt to sync the DB per the instructions on the Graphite site, you get this lovely error:
<em>ImproperlyConfigured: The SECRET_KEY setting must not be empty.</em>
To add insult to injury all the mail threads on this topic have no answers and there is no documentation to clue you in. So here is the answer, the setting is hidden away in <em>webapp/graphite/app_settings.py</em>. Now the screwy bit is the instructions in that file tell you not to make changes BUT even if you make the setting in your local_settings.py IT STILL DOESN'T WORK!
