We recently had to get our OSX Server sending logs via syslog (UDP) to our central log server. After configuring the syslog.conf file, I noticed the logs weren't making it to the Syslog central server.

A subsequent tcpdump revealed the OSX server was sending logs to port 51 instead of 514, even thought the syslog.conf file read as follows:

[...]
*.info   @192.168.1.10:514
[EOF]

Omitting the port number lead to the logs not being forwarded at all.

The explanation was OSX apparently requires a blank line at the bottom of the syslog.conf file and this rule was the last line. Adding the port back in and a blank line at the end of the file resulted in normal behavior.
