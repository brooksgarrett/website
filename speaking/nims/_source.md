#  The Challenge of Incident Response

---

## Declaring an incident

*  What is an incident?
    *  Virus?
    *  Breach?
    *  SPAM?
*  Who is notified?

---

## Incident scale

*  How do you respond to an incident?
    *  A single virus?
    *  A massive worm?
    *  California fell into the ocean?

---

## Standardizing

*  Does every department have the same framework for response?
    *  Incidents are bigger than just IT
*  Does the framework cover roles and functions?
    *  An emergency is not the place for freelancers

# Federal government to the rescue
