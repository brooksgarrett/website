So after publishing the NRSL webservice http://brooksgarrett.com:81/json/SHA1_HASH (No longer functional), I'm looking for a new project. I'm thinking of munging and exposing the Microsoft Update list as a XML feed for powering internal patch management tools. I'll post more when I get it implemented.
