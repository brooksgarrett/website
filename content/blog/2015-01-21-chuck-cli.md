My good friend [Daniel Miessler](http://danielmiessler.com/) dropped a [tweet](https://twitter.com/DanielMiessler/status/555880967785545728) the other day talking about the Chuck Norris Database API. Now as soon as I heard there is an API available I had to get it into my shell for those days when humor is all that keeps me from rm -rf / the world.

Here's how I did it.

```bash

➜  ~  tail -n 1 ~/.oh-my-zsh/lib/aliases.zsh
alias chuck="curl -s http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random/ | egrep -oh '\"joke\": \"[^\"]+' | awk -F \\\" '{print \$4;}'"
➜  ~  chuck
Chuck Norris doesn't use GUI, he prefers COMMAND line.

```
