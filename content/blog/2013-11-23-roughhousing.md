I'm an absolutely huge fan of rugby so what comes next may shock you:

>  I regularly flip, turn, body slam, and fold my two year old.

To clarify I'm not injuring him or punishing him but instead engaging in old-fashioned rough housing. Typically you would be made aware of the activity by the sounds of laughter and squeals emanting from his mouth. The video below is absolutely spot on given one important rule:

>  Know the difference in "DADDY STOP (giggle giggle *TACKLE*)" and "Daddy, Stop."

I believe most of the benefits the video below describes are real from personal experience and add on that not only do you form trust bonds but you gain a very strong ability to read and understand your child. So go; boldly body slam that kiddo onto the couch!
