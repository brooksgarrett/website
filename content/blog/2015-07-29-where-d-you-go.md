I've been gone for a while and sorry (truly) for that. I've been really busy lately working on assisting with a course being taught at Black Hat and transitioning into a new position at my primary job.

All said it's an exciting time in my life. I'm surrounded by energetic and intelligent people who make me better in every way. I'm supported by an excellent family. I'm incredibly thankful for everyone in my life right now. Very soon I'll be publishing a new talk called *pandocmonium* highlighting a new documentation framework; why it is important; and why it is doomed to fail.
