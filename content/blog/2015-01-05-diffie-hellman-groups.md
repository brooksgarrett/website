I've been working with VPNs quite a bit recently and keep running into issues where the other party uses the bit strength and group number for Diffie-Hellman groups interchangeably. Here is a quick reference list:

+  Group 1: 768-bit
+  Group 2: 1024-bit
+  Group 5: 1536-bit
+  Group 14: 2048-bit
+  Group 15: 3072-bit
+  Group 19: 256-bit EC
+  Group 20: 384-bit EC
