title: Windows with Git
---

I've nearly exclusively used Linux for all blogging, development, and research.
The Bash command line is just too powerful to ignore. Now with Microsoft making
major strides to improve PowerShell I'm finding myself spending more and more
time on my Windows machine.

Running a VM just for git and vim is a silly thing to do. I spent about 10 minutes
getting git working on my Windows laptop and getting my blog workflow up and
running.

I'm using the following tools:
+ [Atom Editor](https://atom.io/)
+ [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
+ [KeePass 2](http://keepass.info/)
+ [KeeAgent](http://lechnology.com/software/keeagent/)
+ [plink](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)
