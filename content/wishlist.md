I have friends from all around the world and a massive family. It is inevitable that an occasion arises which social edict demands someone purchase me a gift. To be clear, I'm pretty happy with my life and the things I have and gifts are usually a seriously generous but unnecessary gesture.

That said, I sincerely appreciate receiving gifts and I'm notoriously hard to buy for (if I really *really* want something I tend to go buy it myself.) Thus, I established this page to list the odds and ends that I'd really like to have but I'm not going to buy for myself (and if I do I'll remove it from this page!)
