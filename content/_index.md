My name is Brooks Garrett and I am an Information Security professional based
out of Valdosta, GA. This site is a collection of my thoughts, projects, and
talks.

I cover and consider a wide range of topics which tend to track with my evolving
interests and hobbies. Generally anything relevant to gun law, firefighting,
information security, or rugby are fair game. You may encounter the odd cat
or other meme and you may not like my sense of humor. My apologies in advance.

Please feel free to reach out via email by using webmaster@brooksgarrett.com. By
replacing "webmaster" with my first name you'll skip the filters and get a much
faster reply.
