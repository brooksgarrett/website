# Something Bad Happened
Let's not focus on _blame_. Instead let's find a solution. You have two options:

+  Keep reloading this page and hope it works
+  Fork this site on GitHub and send me a pull request: https://github.com/brooksgarrett/website


I suppose you _could_ just wait long enough and I'll fix it. So you've at least got that going for you.
